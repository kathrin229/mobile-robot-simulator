# mobile-robot-simulator

A project that simulates a vacuum cleaning robot in different environments.

## The code
Run the main function in `playground.py` to start the simulator.


## Next steps
As next steps, the robot will be trained using an evolutionary algorithm. Apart from that, a localization with Kalman filter will be provided.
